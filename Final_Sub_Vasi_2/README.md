# Bring the Light

## Inspiration
This project draws from two contrasting yet complementary sources of inspiration:

Cyberpunk Elements: The neon grids, symmetrical patterns, and reactive light effects take inspiration from the futuristic, electric energy of cyberpunk worlds & space.
Wes Anderson's Pastel Universe: The architecture, warm tones, and symmetrical design inspired by Wes Anderson's movies.

The goal was to combine these styles to create an environment where high-energy dynamics and a cozy charm coexist with different light elements and light sources.

## How to Use
This project is interactive and allows users to toggle between modes and explore various effects. Below is a guide to the controls:

### Key Controls

SPACE: Toggle between the Neon/Cyberpunk Mode and the Wes Anderson Pastel Mode.

Neon Mode: Displays symmetrical patterns, audio-reactive particles, and a glowing grid.
Pastel Mode: Showcases a building with dynamic lights, moving curtains, and streetlights.

#### Cyberpunk-World Shortcuts:

"g": Activate or deactivate the Neon Grid in Cyberpunk Mode 
Displays a neon glow grid that is being gradually created with light "trails"

"f": Activate or deactivate pattern avoidance in Neon Mode.
Particles react dynamically, avoiding or being attracted to the central pattern.

"b": Activate or deactivate Black Hole Mode in Neon Mode.
Particles are swallowed into a central black hole, contributing to its glowing energy.

"r": Randomize the symmetrical pattern in Neon Mode.

Mouse: when mouse moves, more and more particles are being generated.

Audio: Particles react to audio levels, creating a synchronized visual effect

#### Wes-Anderson shortcuts:

"d": Switch between Light Mode and Dark Mode.
Light Mode uses warm pastel colors.
Dark Mode has as only main light sources the window lights and the fireflies.

"l": Toggle lights on/off:
Activates streetlights, and a glowing light above the door when in dark mode.

Mouse : Fireflies actively follow the mouse. If the mouse is stationary, they revert to autonomous wandering.

Audio: the curtains are getting "longer" and close up the windows, if the sound is louder.

## Setup Instructions
Open the index.html file in a modern browser (Live Server) and microphone permissions enabled.
Ensure the microphone is active for audio-reactive features.
Use the controls listed above to explore both modes and their unique elements.
